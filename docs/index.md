# Application-Name development guides

<!-- This index.md defines the home page for the application / service documentation in Backstage. Add links to the main topics in the `\docs` folder on this page, replacing the placeholder sections below. You can also create a sidebar navigation for Backstage docs by configuring `mkdocs.yaml` to include the main sections of the docs. See [Publishing docs in SB Backstage](https://github.com/simplybusiness/know/blob/master/docs/_contributors-guide/backstage_techdocs_guide.md). -->

<!-- Markdown files in the repository root folder are ignored in Backstage. You'll need to link to this index.md from the README.md in the repository root. For an example, see [Rater README.md](https://github.com/simplybusiness/rater). Any significant content in the README.md in the repository root should be moved to the '/docs` folder. -->
